Random Speed Test:

 This program inserts random Strings of length 10
 Into different types of maps as <String, Integer> pairs.

Enter 10,000 strings to insert into:
ULLMap: 1.16 sec
MyHashMap: 0.10 sec
Java's Built-in HashMap: 0.01 sec

Enter 100,000 strings to insert into:
ULLMap: --Stack Overflow -- couldn't add 100000 strings of length 10.
MyHashMap: 0.58 sec
Java's Built-in HashMap: 0.20 sec
